This directory is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) source for a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site. 


## Local development

To install plugins locally:
```
bundle install
```
using [Ruby Bundler](https://bundler.io/).

Run `bundle update` regularly to ensure up-to-date with the [versions installed](https://pages.github.com/versions.json) of the GitHub pages Jekyll build system.

Build the site and watch for changes:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
